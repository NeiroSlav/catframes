!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The canvas size of all images in the current directory
may be changed, their content may be resized.
They may also be renamed and be converted to another format.
Be sure, that you have a copy of the folder before
running this command.

Expected behaviour:
The slightly larger images will be cropped (to the left-top
corner). The images, that are much larger, will be resized down.
And the smaller images will be expanded with a green color (from
the left-top).

The result image resolution are resolved automatically
as the most common resolution in the folder.

If you are agree, run this command
with the flag "{}".
