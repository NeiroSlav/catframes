# Features

## 1. Fixing unstable frame size

Some software by some reason may save a part of frames with negligible cropping (about 8 pixels).

![Feature 1, cropping](/ReadMe%20images/case1_1.png)

![Feature 1, extending](/ReadMe%20images/case1_2.png)

Even if this is not your case (it scales the image, for instance),
if a resolution was changed to very close one,
it's still better to use cropping/extending on video, than scaling, to prevent further quality lose.

The script `images_fix_resolution.py` aligns the frames to the left-top corner.

## 2. Fixing the case, one changes a camera settings during a day

A video have a static resolution, but a camera resolution may be changed by a human.
If the change is small, this case will be indistinguishable from the previous one.
But if the change is significant, there is an opportunity to process it differently.

### A change to approximately the same aspect ratio

We can solve this, resizing the frames without preserving their aspect ratio.

### A change to a very different aspect ratio

# Installation

## Requirements

1. Bash
2. Python 3
3. ImageMagick
4. FFmpeg

## Usage

1. `images_fix_resolution.py` ensures, that all images in the current directory have the same resolution.
    1. Finds out, what resolution is most common in this directory.
        1. Renames corrupted images to `{original_filename}_corrupted`.
    2. Converts all the pictures to this resolution.
        1. If a frame much bigger that the target resolution (more than 10% at width or height), it will be resized without preserving its aspect ratio. Because no one wants to lose a large portion of a frame on cctv.
        2. If a frame slightly larger, it will be cropped to the left-top (that looks nicer, this avoids jitter).
        3. If a frame smaller, it will be extended with a green background color. The image will aligned to the left-top corner.
2. `images_to_h264.sh [--delete-images]` compresses them all to a single video file with 1 frame per second.
