## Requirements

1. Bash
2. Python 3
3. ImageMagick
4. FFmpeg

## Usage

1. `extent_override.py` ensures, that all images in the current directory have the same resolution.
    1. Finds out, what resolution is most common in this directory.
        1. Renames corrupted images to `{original_filename}_corrupted`.
    2. Converts all the pictures to this resolution.
        1. If a frame much bigger that the target resolution (more than 10% at width or height), it will be resized without preserving its aspect ratio. Because no one wants to lose a large portion of a frame on cctv.
        2. If a frame slightly larger, it will be cropped to the left-top (that looks nicer, this avoids jitter).
        3. If a frame smaller, it will be extended (aligned to the left-top) with a green background color.
2. `images_to_h264.sh [--delete-images]` compresses them all to a single video file with 1 frame per second.
